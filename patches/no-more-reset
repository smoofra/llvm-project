remove multi-argument form of PythonObject::Reset()

Summary:
With this patch, only the no-argument form of `Reset()` remains in
PythonDataObjects.   It also deletes PythonExceptionState in favor of
PythonException, because the only call-site of PythonExceptionState was
also using Reset, so I cleaned up both while I was there.
