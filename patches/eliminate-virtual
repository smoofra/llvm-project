eliminate virtual methods from PythonDataObjects

Summary:
This patch eliminates a bunch of boilerplate from
PythonDataObjects, as well as the use of virtual methods.
In my opinion it also makes the Reset logic a lot more
clear and easy to follow.   The price is yet another
template.   I think it's worth it.
