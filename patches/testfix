Fix test breakage caused by r374424

Summary:
The build directory name is based on the test method name, so having
two test methods with the same name in the same test file is a
problem, even if they're in different test classes.

On linux and darwin this conflict can go unnoticed, but windows
has different filesystem semantics and it will fail when one
process tries to delete files still held open by another.

The problem is fixed just by changing the name of one of the test
methods.
