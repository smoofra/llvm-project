eliminate virtual methods from PythonDataObjects

This patch eliminates a bunch of boilerplate from 
PythonDataObjects, as well as the use of virtual methods. 
In my opinion it also makes the Reset logic a lot more 
clear and easy to follow.   The price is yet another 
template.   I think it's worth it.
