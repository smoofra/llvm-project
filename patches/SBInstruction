remove FILE* bindings from SBInstruction.

This patch replaces the FILE* python bindings for SBInstruction and
SBInstructionList and replaces them with the new, safe SBFile and FileSP
bindings.

I also re-enable `Test_Disassemble_VST1_64`, because now we can use
the file bindings as an additional test of the disassembler, and we
can use the disassembler test as a test of the file bindings.

The bugs referred to in the comments appear to have been fixed.   The
radar is closed now and the bugzilla bug does not reproduce with the
instructions given.
