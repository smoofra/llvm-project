eliminate one form of PythonObject::Reset()

Summary:
I'd like to eliminate all forms of Reset() and all public constructors
on these objects, so the only way to make them is with Take<> and Retain<>
and the only way to copy or move them is with actual c++ copy, move, or
assignment.

This is a simple place to start.
