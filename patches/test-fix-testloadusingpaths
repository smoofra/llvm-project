test fix: TestLoadUsingPaths should use realpath

Summary:
TestLoadUsingPaths will fail if the build directory has
symlinks in its path, because the real paths reported by
the debugger won't match the symlink-laden paths it's expecting.

This can be solved just by using os.path.realpath on the base
path for the test.
