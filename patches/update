update TestRunCommandInterpreterAPI to use SBFile

If you look at what this test is doing, it's actually quite 
mysterious why it works at all.   It sets the input file 
inside a "with open".   As soon as the with block ends, 
that file will be closed.   And yet somehow LLDB reads 
commands from it anyway.    What's actually happening is that
the file descriptor gets dup'd when something inside LLDB
calls File::GetStream().   I think it's fair to say that 
what this test is doing is illegal and it has no right 
to expect it to work.

This patch updates the test to use the SBFile api, and 
actually transfers ownership of the original file descriptor
to the debugger.
