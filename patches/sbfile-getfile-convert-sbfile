SBFile::GetFile: convert SBFile back into python native files.

This makes SBFile::GetFile public and adds a SWIG typemap to convert
the result back into a python native file.

If the underlying File itself came from a python file, it is returned
identically.   Otherwise a new python file object is created using
the file descriptor.
