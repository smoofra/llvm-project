allow arbitrary python streams to be converted to SBFile

Summary:
This patch adds SWIG typemaps that can convert arbitrary python
file objects into lldb_private::File.

A SBFile may be initialized from a python file using the
constructor.   There are also alternate, tagged constructors
that allow python files to be borrowed, and for the caller
to control whether or not the python I/O methods will be
called even when a file descriptor is available.I
