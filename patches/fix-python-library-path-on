fix python library path on ubuntu 18.04 LTS

When building on ubuntu 18.04 LTS, the python path returned by
./bin/lldb -P does not match the path where the lldb package was
actually installed by finishSwigPythonLLDB.py.

This is because distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib can behave
differently based on whether a prefix is passed in or not.
Ubuntu's python from this era wll return /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
for no prefix, but it will return $prefix/lib/python3.6/site-packages
if there is one.   XCode's python will also do this, returning
/Library/Python/3.7/site-packages for the no-prefix case.

In general no-prefix can mean some system-wide special path set by
the distributor.   We don't want that, we want a path relative to a
prefix.

Additionally, this patch cleans up the path logic in
finishSwigPythonLLDB.py, which was very convoluted and misleading.
